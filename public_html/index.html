            In the first decades of the 20th century, New York City experienced an unprecedented infrastructure boom. 
            Iconic bridges, opulent railway terminals, and much of what was then the worldâ€™s largest underground and 
            rapid transit network were constructed in just 20 years. Indeed, that subway system grew from a single 
            line in 1904 to a network hundreds of miles long by the 1920s. It spread rapidly into undeveloped land
            across upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs, bringing a wave of apartment houses alongside.
